----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect.git
cd GlobalProtect-openconnect

# Install pixi (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Set up development environment
pixi install

# Build CLI tools
pixi run build-cli

# Run tests
pixi run test-cli-comprehensive

# Create conda package
pixi run package-cli
----

=== For Operators

Deploy GlobalProtect OpenConnect in production:

[source,bash]
----
# Install from conda package (recommended)
conda install ./globalprotect-openconnect-cli-2.4.4-hb0f4dca_0.conda

# Or install from conda-forge (when available)
conda install -c conda-forge globalprotect-openconnect-cli

# Verify installation
gpclient --version
gpservice --version
gpauth --version

# Connect to VPN
gpclient connect vpn.company.com
----

=== For Users

Basic usage examples:

[source,bash]
----
# Authenticate to VPN server
gpauth vpn.company.com

# Connect to VPN
gpclient connect vpn.company.com

# Check connection status
gpclient status

# Disconnect
gpclient disconnect
----

== Architecture Overview

GlobalProtect OpenConnect follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
package "CLI Components" {
  [gpclient] - Main VPN client
  [gpservice] - Background service
  [gpauth] - Authentication handler
}

package "Core Libraries" {
  [gpapi] - Core API library
  [auth] - Authentication library
  [common] - Common utilities
  [openconnect] - OpenConnect wrapper
}

package "Build System" {
  [Pixi] - Package management
  [Conda-Forge] - Dependency management
  [Rattler-Build] - Package creation
}

[gpclient] --> [gpapi]
[gpservice] --> [gpapi]
[gpauth] --> [auth]
[gpapi] --> [openconnect]
[Build System] --> [CLI Components]
