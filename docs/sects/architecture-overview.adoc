== Component Descriptions

**CLI Components (Production Ready)**

* **gpclient**: Main VPN client providing connection management, user interface, and configuration handling
* **gpservice**: Background service for connection monitoring, policy enforcement, and system integration
* **gpauth**: Authentication handler with SSO integration, SAML processing, and credential management

**GUI Components (Development/Beta)**

* **gpgui-helper**: GUI helper service that bridges the desktop interface with core VPN functionality
* **Tauri App**: Cross-platform desktop interface built with modern web technologies

**Core Libraries**

* **gpapi**: Core API library providing VPN functionality and system integration
* **auth**: Authentication library supporting multiple protocols and SSO methods
* **common**: Shared utilities and common functionality across components
* **openconnect**: Wrapper around the OpenConnect VPN library

== System Dependencies

The CLI components require:

* **OpenConnect Library**: Core VPN functionality
* **SSL/TLS Libraries**: Secure communication
* **Authentication Libraries**: Kerberos, SAML support
* **System Libraries**: Network, security, and system integration

GUI components additionally require:

* **WebKit Development Libraries**: For the Tauri-based desktop interface
* **GTK Development Libraries**: For native system integration
* **Platform-specific GUI Libraries**: Varies by operating system
