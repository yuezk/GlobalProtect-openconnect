* **Node.js**: Automatically managed by pixi (for frontend components)

**WebKit Requirements (GUI Components)**

GUI components require WebKit development libraries that are not available in conda-forge:

**Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**
```bash
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel cairo-devel gdk-pixbuf2-devel pango-devel
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 cairo gdk-pixbuf2 pango
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# WebKit is included with macOS
# Additional dependencies managed by pixi
```
