* **Binary Size**: ~3.8 MB
* **Status**: âœ… Production Ready

**gpservice - Background Service**

The system service component that manages VPN operations:

* **Background Operations**: Runs as a system service/daemon
* **Connection Monitoring**: Continuously monitors VPN connection health
* **Policy Enforcement**: Implements corporate VPN policies
* **System Integration**: Integrates with system networking and security
* **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles connection recovery and failover
* **Resource Management**: Manages system resources and permissions
* **Binary Size**: ~3.9 MB
* **Status**: âœ… Production Ready

**gpauth - Authentication Handler**

Specialized component for handling authentication flows:

* **Authentication Processing**: Handles various authentication methods
* **SSO Integration**: Supports Single Sign-On workflows
* **SAML Processing**: Processes SAML assertions and responses
